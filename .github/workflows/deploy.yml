# Grant the minimum permissions needed for this workflow to push to the
# `gh-pages` branch using the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN. If your repository has
# branch protection rules that prevent the GITHUB_TOKEN from pushing, create
# a personal access token (PAT) with repo scope and store it in
# `secrets.GH_PAGES_PAT`, then pass it to the action as `github_token`.
